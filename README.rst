Greenshift
==========

A opencv/winapi app for controlling shift, ctrl and alt by flapping a small green circle from a plastic bag infront of your camera.

Make sure you have `visual studio community`_, `cmake`_, `boost libs/headers`_ installed.

Edit env vars in variables.bat to reflect include/library locations.

Open a cmd shell in this dir and run

.. code-block:: bash

    bootstrap.bat

    configure.bat

    build.bat

    run.bat
